#Redirect output

##Redirect to file
Sometimes when debugging large objects or JSON to the console you cannot see
the whole stack as there is a limit to how much the console can hold.

In this situation you can redirect the `stdout` from the `console` to a `file`
using the following command: `npm start > logfile.log`
